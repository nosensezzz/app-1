# app-1

it's a simple app used to test structure, anyone want to learn a customized framework based on listed framework are welcome to join and learn.

# client side used framework include

require.js

react.js as view and event trigger control

sammy.js as router control

// above are basic structure framework

# server side technologies

it's not important what language and db you used for this app, but I will still post my setup and code and REST api used as a reference.

node.js

express.js

mangoose.js

mangoDB - for convienience api structure


# // client side set up steps
1.you need start a server to run client app

python simple httpserver on mac
iis on windows

2.you need install react-tools to continue build dev folder to pruduct folder, you can write non-jsx react.js in product file, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT.
( or you can simple include jsxtransformer, but for everyone not run build from dev to product, you need be really careful when you fetch or push to master)
